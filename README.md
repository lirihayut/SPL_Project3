# Emergency Service Messaging Platform

## Overview

This project implements an **Emergency Service subscription platform** that enables users to report and receive updates about various emergency topics such as fire, police, and medical incidents.

The system is composed of a **Java-based server** and a **C++ client**, communicating through the **STOMP (Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol)**.
It supports both **Thread-Per-Client (TPC)** and **Reactor** server models for efficient, scalable communication management.

Users can log in, join emergency channels, report incidents, receive updates, and generate summaries of events — all through STOMP-compliant messaging.

## Architecture

The platform follows a **client-server architecture** using a message-based protocol.

Main components:

* **Server (Java)** – Implements the STOMP messaging protocol and supports both TPC and Reactor concurrency models.

  * Manages client connections and subscriptions.
  * Broadcasts messages to relevant topics.
  * Handles errors, receipts, and authentication.

* **Client (C++)** – A multi-threaded application that communicates with the server.

  * One thread handles user input, while another processes incoming messages.
  * Allows users to log in, subscribe/unsubscribe to channels, report emergencies, summarize events, and log out gracefully.

* **STOMP Protocol** – Defines the communication structure (CONNECT, SEND, SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, DISCONNECT, MESSAGE, RECEIPT, ERROR).

  * Ensures standard, interoperable communication between clients and server.

## File Structure

* **Server source files** – Java implementation of the STOMP protocol, connection management, and concurrency models.
* **Client source files** – C++ implementation handling user commands, message parsing, and multi-threading.
* **Protocol files** – Message definitions (CONNECT, SEND, etc.) and encoder/decoder implementations.
* **Data files** – JSON input files containing simulated emergency events.
* **Build files** – Maven configuration for the server and Makefile for the client.
* **Output files** – Event summaries and logs generated by clients.
* **Test files** – Example test cases and provided sample executables for validation.
